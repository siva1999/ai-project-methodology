# __SHAP (XAI) Jupyter Notebook__
## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook provides an implementation of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for explaining machine learning models' predictions. SHAP is an XAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence) technique that assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Use the pre-created function to get the processed data.
Model Training: Load the pre-trained ML model using joblib.In this case RandomForestRegressor.
SHAP Explainer: Initializes a SHAP explainer object corresponding to the trained model.
SHAP Values Computation: Computes SHAP values for the dataset using the SHAP explainer.
Visualization: Visualizes SHAP values using various plots such as force plots, summary plots, dependence plots, and waterfall plots.
1. Waterfall Plot (for a specific instance)
Waterfall plot is another way of explaining individual predictions. The prediction starts from the baseline or expected value. Features pushing the prediction higher are shown in red, and those pushing the prediction lower are in blue.

2.  Force Plot (for a specific instance)
Force plots help us understand the contribution of each feature to the prediction for a single instance. The base_value is the value that would be predicted if we did not know any features for the current output (the average output over the training dataset).

3.  Summary Plot
This plot provides an overview of feature importance, with features ranked by the sum of SHAP value magnitudes across all samples. Features pushing the prediction higher are shown in red, and those pushing the prediction lower are in blue.

4. Mean SHAP Plot
In this plot the length of each bar indicates the magnitude of the feature's impact on the model's prediction for data point 0. Longer bars suggest features that have a stronger influence on the prediction, either positively or negatively.

5. Beeswarm Plot
A Beeswarm plot is a summary plot without overlapping points. This plot is designed to provide an overview of the impact of all features for all instances.

6. Dependence Plot
The dependence plot helps us understand the interaction between features. It shows how the prediction's dependency on a single feature changes with its value and interacts with other features.
